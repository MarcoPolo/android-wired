- Fix Sync+Send requirement for futures (they should hangout on the same thread)
- Auto bind android views
- Add a with_composer(fn)
- Add FlexBox support
- Make sure it works with multiple different roots (for multi root projects)
- Package up the library for use in existing android project
- Support exporting a View Component so that this can be used in an existing app. Maybe create an aar (?)
